# GoodLinksParser

This is a cli that parses the output from <https://goodlinks.app>. It currently just let me show the starred items. But should be easy to extend to do more.

Use the makefile to install. It requires .NET5 to run / build, and you must adjust the RuntimeIdentifier in csproj file if you don't use MacOS.
